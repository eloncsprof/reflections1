How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?
Diff showed the changed lines with a - and a + to make drawing attention to it easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
See what changes have been made that could help provide documentation of a fix or fixes that lead to this problem.

As a programmer, when would you want to have a version of your code saved?
Depends on the word version. I would like the VCS to save only on my request but I would like temporary editor
copies to be saved in case of a reboot.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros are there is a fixed amount of work that is accomplished and signified in a commit. Cons are that a user is not
forced to put only one thing in a commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git tries to have all of the file changes save together when all are involved in a logical fix.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Log will show the list of commits with a summary description of the changes. Git diff will show he actual difference in the files
for two different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can always recover the fixed version with get checkout to see working code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
