When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?
Many reasons: To share it, to have it backed up, to be able to get at it from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might have some work in a intermediate state and do not want the changes intermixed with code under revision.
