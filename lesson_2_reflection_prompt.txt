What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Create a .git folder to track all changes. Before doing this no tracking is done.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a intermediate area since want to have perhaps a single set of 1 or more files involved in a single
logic change. Once these files are identified then we can commit the whole set of files as a single commit.
