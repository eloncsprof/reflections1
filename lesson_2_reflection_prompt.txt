What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Create a .git folder to track all changes. Before doing this no tracking is done.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a intermediate area since want to have perhaps a single set of 1 or more files involved in a single
logic change. Once these files are identified then we can commit the whole set of files as a single commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can check working area against staging area with git diff. This will show changes to staging area that should only 
contain one change.

Perhaps you are working on a new feature and do not want to include until completed.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Allows you to see reachability paths

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
